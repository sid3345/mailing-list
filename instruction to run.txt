Admin login instruction:

I have used Google Authenticator for login.
Thus, I cannot share my Gmail credentials as Gmail presently requires mobile no. for verification and its dangerous to share Gmail credentials.
Thus, for login as admin, kindly change line 16 in authRoutes.js (comment added in  code) to your email, and then you can log into that account as admin and can use admin functionalities.

Note: I have added my API keys as well in the zip file uploaded, which are supposed to be very private and not to be shared with anyone, but for convenience and ease of testing the application, I have shared it along with the submission. Kindly do not misuse it as I have trusted you with the keys! SendGrid only provides 50 emails monthly for free, which I had exhausted and had to create a new account with new API key.

I have also added screenshots in the submission zip file for reference.
